## INSPIRATION

The inspiration for this project came after having listened to the <a href="https://www.codenewbie.org/basecs" target="_blank">Base CS Podcast(S1 E4)</a>.
Both [@saronyitbarek](https://twitter.com/saronyitbarek) and [@vaidehijoshi](https://twitter.com/vaidehijoshi) do an amazing Job of
explaining the basics of a Computer Science Degree. Some of the topics covered are Binary, Stacks, Nodes, Trees and, of course, Hex Codes.
Ever since that episode I have been fascinated by what makes the number 16 so special.

## STYLING

I'll be the first one to admit that I have no the foggiest idea of how to make a website look good.
I have therefore had to rely on the skill of others to create an acceptable looking page. The credit for the
design of this page goes to [@adamwathan](https://twitter.com/adamwathan), the creator of [@tailwindcss](https://twitter.com/tailwindcss).
Without all of his hard work the page would look like it was designed by a 5 year old. In 1998.

## PURPOSE

I guess each page has to be designed with a purpose in mind. The purpose of this page is simply for the fun of it. OK OK, I do have
a slight obsession with hex codes ever since the podcast I mentioned above but it was simply a personal passion project.
I hope you enjoy it!
